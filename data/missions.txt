			`A voice says, "This system is restricted. You should stay away."`
			`	A moment goes by, with no reasonable explanation you wonder if that sound was just in your head. The words do however remain, as if burned into your mind.`

				`	(Ignore it.)`
				`	"What's so dangerous that I can't be here?"`
					goto why
				`	"Who are you to tell me what to do?"`
					goto why
			`	"You should stay away." The thought repeats itself, again without warning. You begin to question your wellbeing, or perhaps it really is there.`
			choice
				`	"What's so dangerous that I can't be here?"`
				`	"Who are you to tell me what to do?"`
			label why
			`	You feel a massive rush through your body, as if drowning under some inexplicable emotion. "Human, you would regret ignoring the reservations of the Drak. I am here to tend to the minds of the Forsaken, and they must not be disturbed during their healing. You would fare better to leave me to my task and continue your ill-fated journey."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean, 'tend to the minds of the Forsaken'?"`
				`	"What happened to the Forsaken?"`
				`	"Okay. I'm leaving."`
					decline
			`	"A great calamity befell this species long ago, they regressed to a state of disrepair that rendered them helpless to the challenges they would otherwise find trivial." As the voice says this, a pain reveals itself within your mind, as if a cancer is spreading at an unprecedented rate, you feel as though all your past experiences are fading with it's presence.`
			choice
				`	"What is happening?!"`
				`	"Why are you doing this!"`
			`	Your processes are slowing and then reorienting, things feel different, as though you are no longer the same person. You make your desperate pleas for salvation, for help. Dark figures linger in the shadows but you don't see them, you can't see, and they are whispering, waiting.`
			choice
				`	"I know what you are!"`
				`	"Stop hiding from me!"`
			`	The shadows grow, reaching for you, grasping for what the light abandons, waiting. The darkness ensues and you submit, reaching for the man in the corner.`
			`	"Be gone, quick." the voice says. The cancer within your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air, with no more than a hazy experience to carry with you. Perhaps it was a warning.`

			`As you complete your landing procedure you recall having come here to assist in some testing for new weapons, new for the time at least. Do you want to check in on Barmy Edwards, the lead engineer?`
			choice
				`	(Yes.)`
				`	(No.)`
					defer
			scene "scene/loc0"
			`	You give your name to the receptionist, and she directs you to the hangar where the weapons group does their design and prototyping. Barmy Edward shakes your hand warmly and says, "Ah, <last>. It's been too long! How fortunate for me, I'm actually just putting the finishing touches on a new prototype. You wouldn't be too busy to assist me in some practical testing would you?`
			`	"I'm not sure about this, what would you have me do?" you say.`
			`	"Not much out of the ordinary from our tests in the past," he says. "You'll find a ship of ours in orbit that goes by 'Warlock', it has been fitted with a few of these new weapons. Your job will be to fight it and disable it, then tell us what you think of its weapons."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I suppose for old times sake I can help out."`
				`	"Sorry, I just wanted to check in and see how you were doing."`
					goto catchup
			`	He turns to you and says with a smirk, "Now mind you, we just want you to disable the Warlock, not destroy it. We've recommissioned it from retirement, so it's not top of the line but all the same I want to be able to keep using it for future tests. Understood?"`
			`	"Great," he says, rubbing his hands together with a gleeful expression on his face. He's clearly looking forward to hearing what you think of his latest invention.`
				accept
			label catchup
			`	"I see, well I'm sure we can find someone else up to the task. Regardless Mr <last>, I assure you this new weapon vastly improves on the outdated Plasma Cannon, this will put Kraz Cybernetics in the big leagues!"`
			`	As his tangent about his new invention continues, you think to yourself about the old times and the war, and all the people you've met along the way.`
			`	"How about we get out of here <first>? My work here is done today, I know a homely little bar not far from here."`
			choice
				`	"Of course, it's not like there's a war to worry about anymore."`
			`"Ha well of course, the war kept all of us plenty busy." He leads you out of the facility, all the while telling an anecdote that must be humour for an engineer.`
			`	You follow Barmy into this bar he was telling you of, even with the smear of grease still on his face, he doesn't stick out from the crowd. You both stand at the bar and order your drinks, Barmys order catches you off guard and he notices your expression. "What? A man who works with his hands can't enjoy a drink with some age?" You chuckle and you both tell stories of your early lives, specifically before leaving the ground. He tells how he had some exciting adventures in his youth among the stars but found his passion tinkering and finding ways to improve on outdated equipment.`
			`	He's shocked to discover your origins on New Boston, "You're really from that backwater planet? I'm surprised you were able to escape the racket they have going on there, I was lucky to get out myself"`
			`	"No way you're from New Boston too! What are the chances?" you hastily respond.`
			`	He chuckles, "Small galaxy I suppose." You both have a great time hearing of each others early lives but you wrap up your visit after a long night of bouncing stories back and forth. You say your goodbyes and you head back to your ship.`

			`You head to the hangar to meet up with Barmy Edward, and find him tinkering with a large gun much like an old Plasma Cannon, but somewhat different. Presumably, this is the weapon that you were just attacked with in orbit. "It runs alot hotter, you see," he says. "But the results are impressive."`

			`	"Heh, it's been a while since we've seen a good upgrade to the cannon." he says. "That, boy, was the Plasma Repeater. Of course, it wasn't easy to find where opportunity lies when everyone could have taken a crack at it."`
			`	"When will it be available for sale?" you ask.`
				goto available
			label damage
			`	"Well, you are famous for a reason I suppose." he says. "The idea is that by shrinking the concentrations of superheated plasma we can offload many more bursts onto a target, the effects on said target result in faster build up of heat and of course damage. Of course, big ships can ward of these effects much longer than a smaller ship can, it's always been a notable issue with the orginal design, but it is a hell of a lot more impressive."`
			`	"That is an interesting idea," you say. "Are they available for sale yet?"`
			label available
			`	"Well, I should have an initial model for sale in a month or so," he says. "I'll be interested to see what uses you or anyone else might find for them. Anyway, thanks for your help."`
			`	"How about we celebrate with some drinks? I know a quaint little bar not far from here."
