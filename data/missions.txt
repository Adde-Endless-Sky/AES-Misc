			`	"You should stay away." The thought repeats itself, again without warning. You begin to question your wellbeing, or perhaps it really is there.`

			`	You feel a massive rush through your body, as if drowning under some inexplicable emotion. "Human, you would regret ignoring the reservations of the Drak. I am here to tend to the minds of the Forsaken, and they must not be disturbed during their healing. You would fare better to leave me to my task and continue your ill-fated journey."`

			`	"A great calamity befell this species long ago, they regressed to a state of disrepair that rendered them helpless to the challenges they would otherwise find trivial." As the voice says this, a pain reveals itself within your mind, as if a cancer is spreading at an unprecedented rate, you feel as though all your past experiences are fading with it's presence.`
			choice
				`	"What is happening?!"`
				`	"Why are you doing this!"`
			`	Your processes are slowing and then reorienting, things feel different, as though you are no longer the same person. You make your desperate pleas for salvation, for help. Dark figures linger in the shadows but you don't see them, you can't see, and they are whispering, waiting.`
			choice
				`	"I know what you are!"`
				`	"Stop hiding from me!"`
			`	The shadows grow, reaching for you, grasping for what the light abandons, waiting. The darkness ensues and you submit, reaching for the man in the corner.`
			`	"Be gone, quick." the voice says. The cancer within your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air, with no more than a hazy experience to carry with you. Perhaps it was a warning.`

Barmy Edward shakes your hand warmly and says, "Here's the deal. We've got a new weapon, something that could have helped our chances during the war had we finished prototyping just a little earlier."`
			`	"Of course," you say.`
			`	"Great," he says. "You shouldn't notice too much out of the ordinary other than meeting the Warlock in orbit, it has been fitted with a few of these new weapons. Your job will be to fight it and disable it, then tell us what you think of its weapons."`
			`	He shakes a finger in your face and says, "Now mind you, we just want you to disable the Warlock, not destroy it. We've recommissioned it from retirement, so it's not top of the line, but all the same I want to be able to keep using it for future tests. Understood?"`

			`You head to the hangar to meet up with Barmy Edward, and find him tinkering with a large gun much like an old Plasma Cannon, but somewhat different.

			`	"When will it be available for sale?" you ask.`
				goto available
			label damage
			`	"Well, you are famous for a reason I suppose." he says. "The idea is that by shrinking the concentrations of superheated plasma we can offload many more bursts onto a target, the effects on said target result in faster build up of heat and of course damage. Of course, big ships can ward of these effects much longer than a smaller ship can, it's always been a notable issue with the orginal design, but it is a hell of a lot more impressive."`
			`	"That is an interesting idea," you say. "Are they available for sale yet?"`
			label available
			`	"Well, I should have an initial model for sale in a month or so," he says. "I'll be interested to see what uses you or anyone else might find for them. Anyway, thanks for your help." You say goodbye and head back to your ship.`
