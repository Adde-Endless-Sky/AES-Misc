	description `Through a method practiced in great depth throughout human space, comes the 'Dual Electron Beam' in full force. As an effect of the reinforcement of multiple units, the two Electron Beams work in conjunction with each other to form two coherent beams that boast a significantly more powerful result than that of two separate weapons.`

	description `Decades after buying the rights for the Plasma Cannon, Kraz Cybernetics put this weapon on the shelves of every high-end outfitter of the southern rim. The Plasma Repeater was the golden egg of Kraz Cybernetics and its ticket for interstellar government funding.`
	description `Derived from the original Plasma Cannon, this larger version trades off its larger bursts for a much faster rate of fire of less concentrated bursts. Although the smaller bursts of superheated plasma deal far less damage than its predecessor, it imparts more damage onto the enemy overall.`

	description `A marvel of modern day ingenuity. Not in regards to any Syndicate efforts, more so from what it says about engineers now a days; an inclination to find any 'brand new' configuration or design. Really it's the same hardware and can vary in effectiveness only so much before old technology becomes quite simply just old technology.`

		"hit force" 120
	description `A fearsome weapon despite its age. The 'Ion Mortar' is no more than two classic Ion Cannons mounted onto a rotating turret base. It is because of this that the peaceful Hai often consider this to be a perversion of traditional engineering.`

		"heat damage" 370
		"hit force" 40
	description `Clearly a terrifying child of Kraz Cybernetics, however running on the hotter side. The Quad Plasma Turret owes itself to the largest cooling systems on the market, the heat that just one of these turrets output is enough to put the user at a serious disadvantage if not prepared.`
	description `Barmy Edwards himself strongly discourages relying on any more than a pair of these turrets per ship. While many pilots plainly refuse to operate one of these turrets aboard their ships because of the immense heat it generates, it is curiously popular with pilots traveling from deep within Syndicate space.`

	description "Captains who do not care particularly much about the comfort of their passengers or crew usually find themselves looking towards bunk beds as the answer, which has become quite the joke among crew for hire. For a marginal increase in crew morale, captains can opt to fit their ship with beds that do not stack."

	description `The construction of the new Scud drones prompted a need for an even smaller engine complement than was available at the time. This lead to the creation of the Type 0 Radiant Engine, the Wanderers first ever hybrid engines systems, capable of achieving speeds comparable to a set of Type 1 engines whilst remaining significantly smaller.`
	description `This efficiency serves as a reminder to the Wanderers that their engineering has not stagnated, and that they are still capable of progressing their technology.`

	description `Ancient laws forbid such a weapon from being used in times of conflict, however that doesn't seem to stop any self respecting pirate from using them for personal gain.
